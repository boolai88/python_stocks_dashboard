This project is an interactive stock comparison dashboard built with Python, Bokeh, and yfinance.
It allows users to visualize and compare two different stock tickers over a selected time period, displaying real-time candlestick charts along with optional trend indicators.

Users can choose:

Two different stock symbols

Start and end dates

Technical indicators such as:

30-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)

100-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA)

Linear Regression Line

The dashboard then downloads historical market data from Yahoo Finance, plots synchronized candlestick charts for both stocks, and overlays any selected indicators.
